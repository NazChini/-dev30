###The 3 Principles of Problem Solving

**Solve the problem first, then write the code**

If you can’t think through a solution in plain english, perhaps with a whiteboard, you won’t be able to write code that will solve the problem either. It’s okay to work through problems through code, but if you don’t have a plan of attack before coding, you’re wasting your time.

**Break your problem down into small, bite sized chunks**

Obviously, the best first step is to think of the first step. Break your problem up into the smallest possible solvable problem. At this point, your problem may be too big to solve the whole thing in your code/on paper/on a white board. Allow yourself to break it into a first smaller problem and worry about how solving that first problem may inform what the next problem is.

**Test every assumption as you code, with the debugger**

Lastly, as you write code, test your code. If there is “red” in your console, fix it. Utilize the debugger and console as much as possible. If you think a variable should be assigned to a value, ensure that it indeed is. Never assume that anything is working as intended. If you write 30 lines of code without testing your code and you begin to have errors, you’ll have to retrace all 30 lines, which may be a mess. Line by line, test your assumptions. As you gain experience and are able to trust yourself more and trust your debugging skills more, you’ll be able to iterate less and can just code. For now, assume your prone to make many mistake and assumptions.
