JS Topics practised / Learnt:

 - Objects - a data structure in JS of key:value pairs
 - Accessing Property Values: You can access values of an object's properties using either dot notion or bracket notion. Note that if you use bracket notation, you'll need to use quotes.
 - Setting Object Properties: via dot notation or bracket notation.
 - Object Methods: When an object has a property who's value is a function, we call it a method as we're giving our object the ability to do something.
    - In JavaScript, functions can be referenced by objects and other variables, so technically they don't "belong" to objects, they're just able to be referenced by objects.
    - Primitives are "pass by value" which means that you can make copies of them. Objects (arrays, function, etc) are "pass by reference" which means that when you try and make copies, they are not actually copied, but instead you create more references to the same values. (solution: spread operator)
- Accessing Nested Objects: By simply chaining our dot notation (or bracket notation) we can access deeply nested objects.
- Loop through objects using the for...in loop.
