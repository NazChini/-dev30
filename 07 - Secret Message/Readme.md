JS Topics practised / Learnt:

 - Arrays - creating, accessing items
     - adding items: push(), unshift()
     - removing items: 
          - pop(), shift()
          - specifying a shorter array length after array declaration
          - array.splice(<starting index>, <optional - how many items to remove>, <optional - what you might want to replace removed items with>)
          - Replacing array items
               -  We can replace items in an array by simply reassigning that index.
               - or use array.splice()
 - Thereâ€™s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called garbage collector. It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.
