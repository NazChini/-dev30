JS Topics practised / Learnt:

 - Understanding scope of variables
      - "Scope is a well-defined set of rules for storing variables in some location, and for finding those variables at a later time." ~  Kyle Simpson
      - variables created in the function scope / conditional scope / local scope will be considered within the specific bodies and not access same named variables that exist in the global scope.
 - scope of variables defined with let and const
   -  When you declar variables with let and const inside of a block ({}), a new scope is created.
