JS Topics practised / Learnt:

 - Functions in JS
 - Default Arguments (ES6 Feature)
 - Function expressions vs Function declaration
 - Hoisting
    - Function Declarations are LHS (Left Hand Side lookups) and can be thought of as being "hoisted" to the top of their scopes (as opposed to function expressions. An anonymous function initialized as a variable will not be hoisted to the top and therefore will throw an error if invoked before being its definition.)
 - Arrow Functions
    -fun fact: arrow functions change the definition of 'this'
 - the return keyword
    - The return keyword returns a specific value from a function (which by default will be undefined) and immediately exits the function.
